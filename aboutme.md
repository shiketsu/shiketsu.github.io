My name is Shiketsu(しけつ), and you can also call me Zi-Heng.

- My favorate is the classical text 
- as well as the anything `pour L'honneur de l'esprit humain`.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I prefer to write poems, by which I can release my presure, feelings and tears. In a short, I recommend you to read the following one I just created recent days.

[庚子大疫](https://www.52shici.com/works.php?mem_id=118459&works_id=2172845) 

{: .box-poem}
盛世清平畫歌舞，誰憐哀誄遍吳楚。<br>
縱令刺史騎黃鶴，如何顓民畏蝠鼠。<br>
蝠鼠嘈嘈人自緘，嫏嬛漠漠天難語。<br>
秦庭野馬本為鹿，楚殿沐猴猶戴冠。<br>
高廟焉藏大夫血，汗靑仍鑑碧心丹。<br>
那堪市骨黃金臺，鮑椁嬴棺不得安。<br>
蔡甸新平荒壠丘，明堂病胔無人收。<br>
公卿尙有垂龍髥，孝子安裁五色裘。<br>
闔戶豈知多暇憂，閉門應似作牢囚。<br>
夜深幾處哭黔黎，生亦劬勞死亦愁。
